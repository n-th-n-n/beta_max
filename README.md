Welcome to Beta Max, this is in super alpha but I thought I'd share this concept.

I'm hoping this becomes a multi-media DJ platform. Where a user can bring in video, music, and effects all into one screens.

The code is from janky various pieces over the last 4 years from mostly off again code.

Please note it contains the ability to download youtube videos under no circumstances should you download any copyrighted content.
